I'm working through Aho & Ullman's
[Foundations of Computer Science: C Edition](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html).
This repository contains a few of my attempts to implement the data structures
described in the text.

Implementations should include:

- The main struct and constructor function(s)
- Search, insertion, and pruning functions, as appropriate
- A simple suite of tests
- A simple but useful application of the data structure

I'll probably post these to codereview.stackexchange.com on occasion.
